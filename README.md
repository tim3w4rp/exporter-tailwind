# Tailwind Exporter


This Tailwind exporter is an extension to the CSS exporter. It generates an additional file, `tailwind-variables.js` that contains the css variables as a `js` object, in order to import them directly into your **Tailwind config**.

## How to import your variables into your Tailwind config - Example :

Here is a project architecture example :

```bash
# Project architecture example

app
├── styles
│   └── designsystem # Output folder of the exporter
│       ├── colors.css
│       ├── # Other
│       ├── # css
│       ├── # files...
│       └── tailwind-variables.js
└── tailwind.config.js
```

The idea is to import `tailwind-variables.js` in `tailwind.config.js`

```css
/* app/styles/designsystem/colors.css */
/* This file is automatically generated by the tailwind exporter */

:root {  
    --color-primary-dark2: #1c7a44;
    --color-primary-dark1: #25a35a;
    --color-primary-main: #2ecc71;
    --color-primary-light1: #6ddb9c;
    --color-primary-light2: #abebc6;
    --color-primary-light3: #d5f5e3;
    --color-primary-border: #29b866;
    --color-secondary-dark2: #0e4290;
    --color-secondary-dark1: #1358c0;
    --color-secondary-main: #186ef0;
    --color-secondary-light1: #5d9af5;
    --color-secondary-light2: #a3c5f9;
    --color-secondary-light3: #d1e2fc;
    --color-secondary-border: #1663d8;
}
```

```js
// app/styles/designsystem/tailwind-variables.js
// This file is automatically generated by the tailwind exporter

module.exports = {
    'colors': {
        'primary': {
            'dark2': 'var(--color-primary-dark2)', 
            'dark1': 'var(--color-primary-dark1)', 
            'DEFAULT': 'var(--color-primary-main)', 
            'light1': 'var(--color-primary-light1)', 
            'light2': 'var(--color-primary-light2)', 
            'light3': 'var(--color-primary-light3)', 
            'border': 'var(--color-primary-border)', 
        },
        'secondary': {
            'border': 'var(--color-secondary-border)', 
            'dark2': 'var(--color-secondary-dark2)', 
            'dark1': 'var(--color-secondary-dark1)', 
            'DEFAULT': 'var(--color-secondary-main)', 
            'light1': 'var(--color-secondary-light1)', 
            'light2': 'var(--color-secondary-light2)', 
            'light3': 'var(--color-secondary-light3)', 
        },
    }
}
```

```js
// app/tailwind.config.js

const designSystemVariables = require('./styles/designsystem/tailwind-variables'); // Add this line

module.exports = {
    purge: [],
    darkMode: false,
    theme: {
        extend: designSystemVariables, // Add this line to extend tailwind theme with your design system
    },
    variants: {
        extend: {},
    },
    plugins: [],
}
```

That's it ! You can now use the **Tailwind variables** in your templates :

```html
<section class="container mx-auto mt-24">

    <h1 class="text-2xl text-primary">Supernova x Tailwind exporter x Tailwind</h1>
    <p class="text-secondary mt-2">Importing your design system</p>
    <ul class="flex mt-2 text-white">
        <li class="p-2 mr-3 rounded bg-primary-dark2">Dark 2</li>
        <li class="p-2 mr-3 rounded bg-primary-dark1">Dark 1</li>
        <li class="p-2 mr-3 rounded bg-primary">Main</li>
        <li class="p-2 mr-3 rounded bg-primary-light1">Light 1</li>
        <li class="p-2 mr-3 rounded bg-primary-light2">Light 2</li>
        <li class="p-2 mr-3 rounded bg-primary-light3">Light 3</li>
    </ul>

</section>
```
